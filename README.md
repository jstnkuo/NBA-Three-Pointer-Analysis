# NBA-Three-Pointer-Analysis

The Three Pointer has taken over the NBA by storm in the last decade or so. In this analysis we will examine the effect the three pointer has on different aspects of a NBA game by answering the following questions:

  1. How has the average three-point attempt changed over time?
  - We analyze by plotting the three-point attempts of every season starting from 1980s on a line chart
  
  2. How does the three-point shot of a team affect its win rate?
  - We analyze the relationship between three-point percentage and winning percentage by performing linear regression 
  
  3. How does the three-pointer % of teams that won the finals compare to others?
  - We analyze by comparing the three-point percentage of teams that won the finals against the average three-point percentage, plotted on a stacked line chart.
  
  4. How does the percentage of points scored by three pointers compare over time?
  - We analyze by calculating the percentage of points scored by three-pointers over several years, plotting on a staccked bar graph.
    
  The conclusion:
  
   1. The three-point attemp has dramatically increased since the inception of the three-point line.
   2. The three-point percentage has a noticeable correlation to a team's winning success, however, the three-point attempt does not.
   3. In general, the finals winners generally have a higher three-point percentage than the rest of the league.
   4. The percentage of points scored by three-pointers have dramatically increased over time, now over 30% scored by three-pointers.
