# NBA-Three-Pointer-Analysis

The Three Pointer has taken over the NBA by storm in the last decade or so. In this analysis we will examine the effect the three pointer has on different aspects of a NBA game by answering the following questions:

  1. How has the average three-point attempt changed over time?
  2. How does the three point percentage of a team affect its win rate?
  3. How does the three-pointer % of teams that won the finals compare to others?
  4. How does the percentage of points scored by three pointers compare over time?
